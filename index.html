            <p>
                Taking this course introduced me to the fundamental building blocks of web design—HTML, CSS, and visual design principles using Figma. 
                Before starting, I had a basic understanding of websites, but now I appreciate the structure and styling that go into creating functional 
                and visually appealing web pages. One of the key takeaways for me was the importance of proper HTML structure. Learning about semantic 
                elements, accessibility, and how to organize content effectively has given me a solid foundation for writing clean, maintainable code. 
                CSS, on the other hand, was both exciting and challenging. Experimenting with different styling techniques, such as Flexbox and Grid, 
                helped me understand how to create responsive and aesthetically pleasing layouts. Figma was a great tool for planning and prototyping 
                designs before jumping into coding. It helped me visualize spacing, typography, and color schemes, making the development process much 
                smoother. Learning how to translate a Figma design into an actual webpage was a valuable skill that reinforced the importance of consistency 
                in design and development. Overall, this course has given me a strong starting point in web design. While I still have a lot to learn, 
                I feel more confident in my ability to structure and style web pages. Moving forward, I’m excited to refine my skills, experiment with 
                more complex layouts, and explore interactivity with JavaScript.
